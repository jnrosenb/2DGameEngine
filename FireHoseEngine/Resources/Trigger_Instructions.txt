HOW TO CONNECT TRIGGERS:


FROM TRIGGER P.O.V.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Say you want to create an instance of an object with trigger component. Say this object is a switch.

Switch.txt    
	Transform 7 0.25 -5
	Trigger trigger01 5
END

- Here we are saying we want a new switch instance (Switch.txt)  

- We are overriding the transform position to (7.0, 0.25, -5.0)

- And we are overriding the trigger component:
    
	- trigger01 will be the trigger's key. Other objects that suscribe to listen
           to onEnterTrigger or onExitTrigger will need to define this same key if they
           want to be affected by this trigger.

	- 5 will be the collision mask that this trigger will react to. Any object
           that does not have this collisionMask will not even activate the trigger.


FROM CONNECTED OBJ P.O.V.-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ball.txt
	Transform -4 2 -8  
	EVENTS 
		ON_ENTER_TRIGGER
		KEYS
			trigger01
			trigger02
		KEYS_END 
	EVENTS_END
END

	- Here we create a Ball instance. On Events, we are suscribing the instance to
 	  the OnEnterTrigger event, with trigger01 and trigger02 keys. This means that
 	  whenever a OnEnterTrigger happens, if the key of the trigger firing the
 	  event is trigger01 or trigger02, this object will be able to handle that event 

	** Important: Object needs to, foremost, have the collisionMask required by
 	   the trigger
